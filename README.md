# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of the challenge was to implement tools such as D3, GeoJSON, Leaflet, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and APIs to build a webpage that could overlay information regarding tectonic plates, earthquake locations and their magnatudes, as well as play with different map layer views for visual effect. We learned to set up a proper HTML page, created a javascript file that layed out different layers of our map and their respective map elements, and practiced again with API calls to retrieve the data we wanted to visualize.
